# About Me  

<img style = "padding-right: 16px; padding-bottom: 3px; float: left" alt="Dylan's profile photo" align="left" src="../assets/me.jpg" width="35%">


**Hello world!  My name is Dylan.**
   

I grew up mostly in Toronto, where I attended U of T studying Anthropology.  My most formative 2 years, however, were spent in Chicago, IL,
where I completed my Masters Degree in the Social Sciences, taught myself a wide range of tech skills, and worked for
several companies in the city.  

Since returning to Toronto, I have continued to hone my technical sophistication while working in the tech education industry 
and developing my own projects.  

My goal is to reach the next level of my career by combining my research & writing skills with my 
familiarity with digital technology.  With that in mind, I am currently seeking opportunities in Consulting, Software Development,
User Experience Research, Copywriting, and much more.  If you think I would be a good fit at your
organization, please do not hesitate to reach out.  

I recently started a blog called [This Wired World](https://thiswiredworld.wordpress.com/), where I write on
the everyday intersections
 of technology and environmental change in the contemporary world.  I would love it if you had a look!
