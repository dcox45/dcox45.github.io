# About Me  

<img style = "padding-right: 16px; float: left" alt="Dylan's profile photo" align="left" src="../assets/me.jpg" width="200" height="200">

**Hello world!  My name is Dylan.**

I grew up mostly in Toronto, where I attended U of T studying Anthropology.  My most formative 2 years, however, were spent in Chicago, IL,
where I completed my Masters Degree in the Social Sciences, taught myself a wide range of tech skills, and worked for one year for
several companies in the city.  

Since returning to Toronto, I have continued to hone my technical sophistication while working in the tech education industry.  My
goal is to reach the next level of my career by combining my research & writing skills with my familiarity with digital technology.  With
that in mind, I have been seeking positions in Software Development, User Experience Research, Copywriting, and much more.  If you think I would be a good fit at your organization, please do not hesitate to reach out.  

I recently started a blog called [This Wired World](https://thiswiredworld.wordpress.com/), where I write on the everyday intersections
 of technology and environmental change in the contemporary world.  I would love it if you had a look!
