        <h3>The Thesis Project</h3>
        
            <p class="larger-font">
                My thesis work examines two examples of a new form of filmmaking: the interactive 
                documentary, also known as a web documentary. The two films, <a href="https://bear71vr.nfb.ca/">
                Bear71 (2012)</a>  and <a href="http://www.fortmcmoney.com/#/fortmcmoney">Fort 
                McMoney(2013)</a> , both use cutting edge digital storytelling techniques to explore 
                important environmental issues in Western Canada. 
                
            </p> 
            
            <p> <strong> Taken together, I argue that these films can provide
                remarkable insight into the technological and environmental conditions of our present 
                moment - specifically in the context of the Anthropocene, the rise of remote sensing
                technology, and the influence of cybernetics on the thinking of artists.  </strong>
            </p>
                      
            <p>
                To understand how these technologically complex documentaries operate, I borrow heavily
                from thinkers across various disciplines who theorize interactivity as a cybernetic phenomenon - that is,
                made possible by a real-world connectivity or intersection between humans, animals, machines, and environments.  
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Part of the challenge of this thesis project was getting insight into how the documentaries actually
                affected viewers.  To help obtain this kind of data, I submitted an application for 
                an applied research grant.  The merit-based grant provides 
                money, mentorship, and the User Experience (UX) lab & equipment of <a href="https://www.gfk.com/en-us/careers/overview/">GfK</a> 
                in downtown Chicago.  
            </p>
        
            
            <p>    
                Upon being awarded the 2016 grant, I then planned, organized, and executed 
                a UX research study into the two interactive documentaries.  This involved applying for institutional review 
                (carried out for all research involving living human subjects), recruiting participants to watch the 
                documentaries, and carrying out observation and interviews to obtain data. 
            </p>
            
            <p>    
                Overall, the paper concludes that these two documentaries are exemplary of the 
                relatively recent turn to simulation and gaming as a way of understanding, documenting, 
                and predicting the real world (rather than using linear, fixed narratives).  This turn 
                to simulation and gaming is not limited to the world of documentary, but in fact 
                is part of a wider reconfiguration of humanity's relationship with technology and 
                with the natural world. For viewers, this use of simulation provides opportunities
                to "rehearse" one's position in a complex world, and experience a narrative on 
                multiple sensory levels.
