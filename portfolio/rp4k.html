         <em><p align = "center"><a href="https://realprogramming.com/">Real Programming</a> is a tech education startup company with locations 
         across Canada.  The company focusses on video game programming/design as a way of teaching young learners 
         more sophisticated coding practices.

        <h2>My Work as a Video Game Programming Instructor</h2>
        
        
        <p>
            Utilizing a variety of software tools and programming languages, I currently lead small classes of students
            through object-oriented programming lessons, gradually building a working video game from beginning to end.  Along 
            the way, time is taken to explain fundamental coding concepts and practices - such 
            as refactoring, version control, and breakpoints.  
        </p>
        <p>    
            In addition, the mathematics widely used to program
            the movement of sprites and other game objects - especially trigonometry - is explained.  While this can sometimes
            lead to some bored students, it makes for better coders!  
        </p>
