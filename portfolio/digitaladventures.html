        <h2>My Work as Lead Technology Instructor:</h2>
        
        <p>
            This story begins with sheer coincidence. While riding my bike one day, I passed by the 
            Lincoln Park studio of DA.  Looking inside, I noticed that their cieling was leaking water,
            which was pooling on the floor of the studio full of expensive tech
            equipment.  It was a Sunday, and so there was nobody in the studio. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So, I grabbed one of DA's flyers on the front door, called up my future boss, Arjun, 
            and informed him of the situation.  After thanking me, I eventually asked Arjun if DA 
            was hiring, and of course, they were.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Over the course of about 2 months, I was given crash courses in coding fundamentals,
            while practicing specific projects on my own time.  It was my role to then teach these 
            projects to students. </strong> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            By the summer of 2016, plans were made
            to have me manage the studio I worked in, so that the company was free to expand to other parts of Chicago.
            This new role would involve full responsibility over the Lincoln Park studio.  
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately,
            the work visa application did not work out, and I had to leave the United States, and go back to Toronto.  
            I wish Digital Adventures the best of luck!  
        </p>
