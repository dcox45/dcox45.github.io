        <h3>My Work as Lead Technology Instructor</h3>
        
        <p>
            This story begins with sheer coincidence. While riding my bike one day, I passed by the 
            Lincoln Park studio of DA.  Looking inside, I noticed that their roof was leaking,
            and water was pooling on the floor of the room - which was full of expensive tech
            equipment.  It was a Sunday, and so there was nobody in the studio. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So I grabbed on of DA's flyers on the front door, called up my future boss, Arjun, 
            and informed him of the situation.  After thanking me, I eventually asked Arjun if DA 
            was hiring, and they were.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Over the course of about 2 months, I was given crash courses in coding fundamentals,
            while practicing specific projects on my own time.  It was my role to then teach these 
            projects to students. </strong> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            By the summer of 2016, plans were made
            to have me oversee the studio I worked in, as the company expanded to other parts of Chicago.
            This new role would involve full responsibility over the Lincoln Park studio.  Unfortunately,
            the work visa application did not work out, and I had to leave the United States back to Toronto.  
            I wish Digital Adventures the best of luck!
