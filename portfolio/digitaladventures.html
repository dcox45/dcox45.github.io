        <h3>My Work as Lead Technology Instructor</h3>
        
        <p>
            This story begins with sheer coincidence. While riding my bike one day, I passed by the 
            Lincoln Park studio of DA.  Looking inside, I noticed that their roof was leaking,
            and water was pooling on the floor of the room - which was full of expensive tech
            equipment.  It was a Sunday, and so there was nobody in the studio. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So, I grabbed on of DA's flyers on the front door, called up my future boss, Arjun, 
            and informed him of the situation.  After thanking me profusely, I asked Arjun if DA 
            was hiring, and of course, they were.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Over the course of about 2 months, I was given crash courses in coding fundamentals,
            Ruby on Rails, 3D Printing, Video Game Design with the Unity Engine, Minecraft Modding,
            Robotics, Rasberry Pi programming, and all the concepts and thinking that goes with 
            these technologies.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My role was to instruct young learners in all of the above.  </strong> Eventually, plans were made
            to have me take over one of the locations, as the company expanded to other parts of Chicago.
            This new role would involve full responsibility over the Lincoln Park studio, and would have my 
            income directly tied to the success of the studio (the amount of registrations per month).  Unfortunately,
            my work visa application did not work out, and I had to leave the United States back to Toronto.  
            I wish Digital Adventures the best of luck!
