        <p>
           This Wired World is an effort to engage with the intersecting issues of planetary ecological change and technological 
            change in a way that emphasizes storytelling, narrative, and even mythology.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The blog, while serving in part as a dumping ground 
            for my unpublished academic writings, also contains short stories, fiction and nonfiction, and reflections
            on real experiences I have had.

            I have always been interested in people's cultural relationships with 
            their environments (a.k.a Environmental Anthropology).
            During my year as a Masters student at the University of Chicago, I 
            became especially preoccupied with climate change as an issue that had begun to supercede many of the 
            traditional concerns of social scientists.   
         </p>
         
         <p>
            However, a problem that many people were pointing out was that 
            the scientific community has consistently
            failed to connect issues of the global environment to everyday life. 
            The language of climate science is often cryptic and inaccessible, and so 
            it often fails to connect with ordinary people. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            At the same time, a lot of scholars, especially at Uchicago, were 
            emphasizing the intersection between global environmental change and the history
            of technology. For these scholars, not only is climate change partly a product of human technology 
            (our ability to metabolize fossil fuels, for example), 
            but our very ability to perceive, imagine, and measure climate phenomenon is 
            predicated on specific technological capabilities and infrastructures.  (For more on this, you should 
            check out the work of Joe Masco and Michael Fisch, both Uchicago professors).
             
         <p>
            This Wired World is located at this crucial intersection of climate change and technology.
            It engages with these issues through more creative writing - less constrained by the demands of
            science and academia.  While these issues
            are highly technical and complex, they must be thought of and talked about in more than a scientific way, 
            especially if we want to have a wider impact beyond academia.
