         briefly describe the project and the ideas behind it.

        <p>
           This Wired World is an effort to engage with the intersecting issues of global environmental change and technological 
            change - in a way that extends to more everyday, relatable happenings.

            The blog, while serving in part as a dumping ground 
            for my unpublished academic writings, also contains short stories, fiction and nonfiction, and reflections
            on real experiences I have had.

            I've always been interested in people's cultural relationships with 
            their environments (aka Environmental Anthropology).
            During my year as a Masters student at the University of Chicago, I 
            became especially preoccupied with climate change as an issue that seemed to superceding many of the 
            traditional concerns of social scientists.   
         </p>
         
         <p>
            However, a problem that many peoople were pointing out was that 
            the scientific community has consistently
            failed to connect issues of the global environment to everyday life. 
            The language of climate change is often cryptic and inaccessible, and so 
            the literature often fails to connect with ordinary people. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            At the same time, a lot of scholars, especially at Uchicago, were 
            writing on the intersection between environmental change and the history
            of technology. That is, not only is climate change partly a product of human technology, 
            but our very ability to perceive, imagine, and measure climate phenomenon is 
            predicated on specific technological capabilities.  (For more on this, you should 
            check out the work of Joe Masco and Michael Fisch, both Uchicago professors).
             
         <p>
            So, This Wired World attempts to ground these global, seemingly ephemeral issues of technology and environment
            in more legible wrijting - less constrained by the demands of science and academia.  These issues
            cannot be ignored, but they must be engaged with in more than a scientific way - in a way that 
            recognizes the mythmaking power of narrative and storytelling.
