         <em><p align = "center">The NCSBN is a national non-profit organization that helps standarize and regulate
         nursing in the United States. Among its many roles, the organization supports research studies into 
         the Nursing industry and Nursing Education.</p> </em>

        <h2>My Work as Research Associate:</h2>
            
        <p>
            In 2015, the NCSBN committee for Nursing regulation was tasked with finding alternative 
            ways of measuring nursing education program quality in the United States.  The traditional metric
            for determining quality 
            was was the NCLEX-RN (National Council Licensure Examination-Registered Nurse) pass rates.  But this 
            measure was determined to be flawed in recent literature, for a variety of reasons.
            </p>
            
        <p>
            <strong>To help ensure
            that hospitals across the United States are sent quality nursing graduates, this issue 
            of measuring education program quality is crucial.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>
            My role was to review and analyze the literature on this issue - collect qualitative and quantitative data, 
            summarize the findings of studies, 
            and contribute towards a conclusive report on the issue.  </strong> 
            In one month, I read and analyzed over 100 published articles
            on the subject of nursing education, and the differing methods used to meaure its quality.  I also covered 
            literature related to the more general topic of university/college assessment.  
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
            Such a topic is, of course, complex and disputed, and so the final report on this issue is forthcoming.
