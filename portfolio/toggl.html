         <em><p align = "center"><a href="https://www.togglar.com/">Toggl AR</a> is a maker of Augmented
             Reality experiences.  With toggl's app, users can spawn and interact with a variety of objects 
             and games, and invite their 
             friends to experience a shared virtual space.

        <h2>My Work as a Unity 3D Developer</h2>
        
         <p>
            Augemented Reality experiences were developed for the Toggl app using the Unity 3D engine, with building and testing taking place via Xcode and iOS.  
        </p>
        
         <p>
             My role was to integrate 3D assets into the engine, giving them physics and behavior, with the aim of producing positive and fun experiences for users that can 
            be shared with friends.  Interactive objects 
            include items such as a boombox, basketball net, and much more! 
        </p>

        <p>
           As a junior developer (working remotely from home), it was expected that I take the necessary steps to familiarize myself with Unity's asset pipeline and development conventions, as well as 
           best practices for scripting behaviour with
           the C# language. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This led to an intense but fruitful learning process of developing and testing Unity scenes from start to finish, and reading up on coding fundamentals 
            that I had never really encountered as someone coming from a non-computer science background. 
        </p>
