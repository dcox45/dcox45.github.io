        <h3>My Work as JavaScript and Python Instructor</h3>
        
         <p>
              At Hatch, my role was to direct classes of young learners (pre-K through 12th grade)
             in JavaScript using the Hatch company online platform.  I was also tasked with teaching 
             more advanced Python classes, which required strong math and problem-solving skills. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
             This role also involved promoting the company across the GTA - travelling to public and private schools and
             encouraging students to sign up.  Over the course of nearly a year, I have recruited dozens of students
             to the Hatch program, helping to generate revenue.
